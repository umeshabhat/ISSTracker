ISSTracker
==========
A python program to compute and display visible ISS passes.

Runs on a Raspberry Pi with an Adafruit PiTFT touchscreen LCD.
Also uses a BlinkStick to signal when ISS is passing overhead.

For best accuracy, connect to the 'net and run at least once 
every 2 weeks so it can download the latest ISS TLE's (Two Line 
Elements) from a NASA web page.
